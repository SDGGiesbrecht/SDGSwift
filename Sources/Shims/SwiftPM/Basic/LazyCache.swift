// FIXME: This wrapper could benefit from local static variables, in which case
// we could embed the cache object inside the accessor.
//
/// Thread-safe lazily cached methods.
///
/// The `lazy` annotation in Swift does not result in a thread-safe accessor,
/// which can make it an easy source of hard-to-find concurrency races. This
/// class defines a wrapper designed to be used as an alternative for
/// `lazy`. Example usage:
///
/// ```
/// class Foo {
///     var bar: Int { return barCache.getValue(self) }
///     var barCache = LazyCache(someExpensiveMethod)
///
///     func someExpensiveMethod() -> Int { ... }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// See: https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-1042
public struct LazyCache<Class, T> {
    // FIXME: It would be nice to avoid a per-instance lock, but this type isn't
    // intended for creating large numbers of instances of. We also really want
    // a reader-writer lock or something similar here.

    /// Create a lazy cache from a method value.
